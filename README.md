# IBM Data Science Capstone

This is the final project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Program.

## Purpose

It's purpose is to predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket
will land successfully.

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62
million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each,
much of the savings is due to the fact that SpaceX can reuse the first stage.
